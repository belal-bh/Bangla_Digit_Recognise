# Bangla_Digit_Recognise
```Hi!!```
I'm beginner in ```Machine Learnng```.
This is a simple machine learning project (like printing ```"Hello world!!!!!"``` as first program; But it's not string rather than a ```Neural Network!!!!!``` ).
I'm trying to train a machine learning molel which recognise hand-written bangla digit.

There was no available enough free *bangla-hand-written-digit*'s ```dataset``` on the internet to use in this project (when was searched for it).
So, I'm trying to make own dataset of bangla hand-written digit to train model for my learning purpose.

## Required Packages

This project was developed on Windows-10 using ```Python 3.6```.
```

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
