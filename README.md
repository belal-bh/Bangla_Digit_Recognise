# NRF_17_ML_Challenge_Bangla_Digit_Recognise

**Bangla Hand-written Digit Recognise**

This project is a learning step of tensorflow and machine learning.
I'm trying to train a machine learning molel which recognise hand-written bangla digit.

There is no available free dataset in the internet to use in this project.
So, I'm trying to make own dataset of bangla hand-written digit to train model for my learning purpose.

This project may contain element of other's project and tutorial only for my learning purpose.
