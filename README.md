# Bangla_Digit_Recognise

Hi! 
I'm beginner in Machine Learnng.
This is a simple machine learning project (like printing "Hello world!!!!!" as first program; But it's not string rather than a neural network!!!!! )
I'm trying to train a machine learning molel which recognise hand-written bangla digit.

There is no available (enough) free bangla-hand-written-digit's dataset in the internet to use in this project yet (5.12.17 when was google for it).
So, I'm trying to make own dataset of bangla hand-written digit to train model for my learning purpose.

## Required Packages

This project was developed on Windows-10 using **Python 3.6**.
Basic packages were used in this project:
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
opencv
jupyter-notebook

## Welcome back
This project may contain idea of other's tutorial for my learning purpose.

You are welcome to modify these project and use them in your own projects.
